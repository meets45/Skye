        Welcome to Skye, the ultimate weather app for your everyday needs. At
        Skye, our mission is to provide you with accurate and reliable weather
        information to help you plan and prepare for your day. Here's a little
        more about who we are and what we stand for:
        <br />
        <br />
        <p>
          • Skye was founded in 2022 with a vision to create a weather app that
          people could rely on, no matter where they are in the world. We
          started as a small team of meteorologists and developers who were
          passionate about weather and technology, and have since grown into a
          larger community of people who share our values and goals. <br />
          <br /> • Our team is made up of experienced meteorologists, software
          developers, and designers who work together to ensure that our app is
          accurate, reliable, and easy to use. We're dedicated to staying
          up-to-date with the latest weather forecasting technologies and are
          always looking for ways to improve our app.
          <br />
          <br />• Skye offers a range of features to help you stay informed
          about the weather in your area. Our app provides real-time weather
          updates, hourly and daily forecasts, radar and satellite maps, severe
          weather alerts, and more. You can customize the app to show the
          information that matters most to you, whether that's temperature, wind
          speed, precipitation, or something else entirely.
          <br />
          <br />• If you have any questions, feedback, or concerns, please don't
          hesitate to reach out to us at <b>support@skyeapp.com </b>
          We're always happy to hear from our users and will do our best to
          assist you in any way we can. Thank you for choosing Skye!
